This image below shows a very simple circuit. There are four components, all connected up with wires.

1) The cell provides energy to the circuit in the form of electricity. A cell has a positive and a negative side. Electric current flows from the positive side of the cell to the negative side of the cell.

2) The Light Emitting Diode (LED) is a type of Output Component. When current flows through the LED, it emits light. Different LEDs can produce many different colours of light, and some can even produce multiple colours.

3) The resistor helps protect the LED. Resistors use up some of the energy from the cell, and therefore reduce the amount of energy that reaches the LED. Without the resistor, the LED could burn out, in much the same way as a fuse does in many of your household appliances.

4) The switch acts as a break in the circuit. When the switch is open then no current can flow through the LED or the resistor. When the switch is closed, the circuit is complete and current can flow, causing the LED to switch on.
