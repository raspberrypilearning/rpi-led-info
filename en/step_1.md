This image below shows a very simple circuit. There are four components, all connected up with wires.

1) The cell (or battery) provides the circuit with energy in the form of electricity. A cell has a positive and a negative side. Electrical energy (or current) flows from the positive side to the negative side of the cell.

2) The **l**ight-**e**mitting **d**iode (LED) is a type of output component. When current flows through the LED, it emits light. Different LEDs can produce different colours of light, and some can even produce multiple colours.

3) The resistor helps protect the LED. Resistors use up some of the energy from the cell, and therefore reduce the amount of energy that reaches the LED. Without the resistor, the LED could burn out, in much the same way as a fuse can burn out in one of your your household appliances.

4) The switch acts as a break in the circuit. When the switch is open, no current can flow through the LED and the resistor. When the switch is closed, the circuit is complete and current can flow, causing the LED to switch on.
